🚀 Today, I successfully deployed an E-Commerce Fraud Transaction Prediction model with Exploratory Data Analysis 🛍️

The dataset was massive, with 1,496,586 rows and 16 features, which made computing and hyperparameter tuning a challenge. After extensive work, I deployed several models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN. 

🏆 The standout performer was the Random Forest model, which provided the best accuracy! To tackle class imbalance, I utilized SMOTE, ensuring a more robust prediction.

Thrilled to see this model in action! 💻✨
